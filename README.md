# Star Wars Battlefront II - Complete DX12 Fix Package 🎮

**Version 1.0** - Community Fix

A comprehensive solution for all DX12-related issues in Star Wars Battlefront II, including shader deadlocks, UI artifacts, and performance problems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download** the entire `SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package` folder to your game directory
2. **Navigate** to the package: `cd SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package`
3. **Run as Administrator** (recommended): `python SWBF2_DX12_Complete_Fix.py`
4. **Launch the game** when prompted
5. **Enjoy stable DX12 gaming!**

## 🔧 What This Fix Solves

### Critical Issues Fixed:
- ✅ **Shader Optimization Deadlocks** - No more infinite "Optimizing Shaders" screen
- ✅ **Control Flow Guard (CFG) Conflicts** - Eliminates stuttering and crashes  
- ✅ **UI Artifacts & Corruption** - Clean UI at all resolution scales
- ✅ **Memory Management Issues** - Optimized allocation and priority
- ✅ **Performance Bottlenecks** - Higher FPS and smoother gameplay

### Technical Improvements:
- **DX12 Mode**: Properly enabled with stability fixes
- **UI Rendering**: Separated from 3D scaling to prevent artifacts
- **Memory Optimization**: Enhanced allocation and process priority
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Automatic fixes when game launches
- **Backup System**: Safe rollback if needed

## 📋 Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Python 3.6+** 
- **Administrator privileges** (recommended for full functionality)
- **Star Wars Battlefront II** (Steam or EA/Origin version)

### Dependencies
The script automatically installs required dependencies:
- `psutil` - For process monitoring and management

## 🎯 Installation & Usage

### Method 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)
1. Download the entire `SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package` folder to your SWBF2 game directory
2. Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in the package directory
3. Run: `python verify_system.py` (optional but recommended)
4. Run: `python SWBF2_DX12_Complete_Fix.py` (as Administrator)
5. Wait for the fix to complete and launch the game when prompted

### Method 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# Navigate to your SWBF2 installation
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\SWBF2\Installation"

# Extract the fix package here
# You should have: SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package\

# Navigate to the package
cd SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify system (optional)
python verify_system.py

# Run the fix
python SWBF2_DX12_Complete_Fix.py
```

### Method 3: Standalone Executable
*(Coming soon - we can compile this to .exe for non-Python users)*

## 🔍 How It Works

The fix operates in four phases:

### Phase 1: Control Flow Guard (CFG) Exceptions
- Adds registry exceptions for SWBF2 processes
- Prevents CFG from interfering with DX12 operations
- Eliminates random stuttering and crashes

### Phase 2: DX12 Configuration
- Enables DX12 mode with optimal settings
- **UI Resolution**: Forced to native (100%) to prevent artifacts
- **3D Resolution**: Maintained at 120% for visual quality
- Creates backup of original settings

### Phase 3: Runtime Monitoring
- Detects when SWBF2 launches
- Applies memory optimizations automatically
- Sets high process priority for better performance
- Monitors for stability issues

### Phase 4: Safety Features
- Creates automatic backups of all modified files
- Generates restore script for easy rollback
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

If you need to revert the changes:

### Option 1: Use the Restore Script
- Double-click `Restore_SWBF2_Settings.bat`
- Run as Administrator if prompted

### Option 2: Manual Restore
1. Copy `SWBF2_DX12_Fix_Package\Backups\Win32Game.cfg.backup` to `Scripts\Win32Game.cfg`
2. Remove CFG registry exceptions (requires admin rights)
